## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I began this project with my preferred approach, which is mobile-first design. I find it to be a very effective methodology. The web layout itself was relatively simple, and did not require much thought. However, I did have to focus on designing the form, ensuring that it was both responsive and aesthetically pleasing. I believe I achieved these goals, and am pleased with the final result.

During the project, I experimented with the clamp() function, which allowed me to create a header that is responsive across all devices, from PCs to smartphones. This function proved to be very useful. However, I did encounter some difficulties when setting the maximum width of the input field during the transition from phones to higher resolutions. Ultimately, I discovered that setting the width to 100% solved this issue.

From a JavaScript perspective, the project was relatively straightforward, although it did provide me with some valuable practice. Overall, I am very happy with the final outcome, and found the project to be both enjoyable and rewarding.

### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
